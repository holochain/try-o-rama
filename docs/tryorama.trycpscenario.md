## TryCpScenario class

A test scenario abstraction with convenience functions to manage TryCP clients and players (agent + conductor).

Clients in turn help manage conductors on TryCP servers. Clients can be added to a scenario to keep track of all server connections. When finishing a test scenario, all conductors of all clients can be easily cleaned up and the client connections closed.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class TryCpScenario 
```

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [addClient(serverUrl, timeout)](./tryorama.trycpscenario.addclient.md) |  | Creates a TryCP client connection and add it to the scenario. |
|  [addClientsPlayers(serverUrls, options)](./tryorama.trycpscenario.addclientsplayers.md) |  | Creates client connections for all passed in URLs and, depending on the options, creates multiple players with DNAs. Adds all clients to the scenario. |
|  [addPlayersWithHappBundles(tryCpClient, playersHappBundles)](./tryorama.trycpscenario.addplayerswithhappbundles.md) |  | Creates and adds multiple players to the scenario, with a hApp bundle installed for each player. |
|  [addPlayersWithHapps(tryCpClient, agentHappOptions)](./tryorama.trycpscenario.addplayerswithhapps.md) |  | Creates and adds multiple players to the scenario, with a set of DNAs installed for each player. |
|  [addPlayerWithHapp(tryCpClient, playerHappOptions)](./tryorama.trycpscenario.addplayerwithhapp.md) |  | Creates and adds a single player to the scenario, with a set of DNAs installed. |
|  [addPlayerWithHappBundle(tryCpClient, appBundleSource, options)](./tryorama.trycpscenario.addplayerwithhappbundle.md) |  | Creates and adds a single player to the scenario, with a hApp bundle installed. |
|  [cleanUp()](./tryorama.trycpscenario.cleanup.md) |  | Shut down and delete all conductors and close all client connections in the scenario. |
|  [shareAllAgents()](./tryorama.trycpscenario.shareallagents.md) |  | Registers all agents of all passed in conductors to each other. This skips peer discovery through gossip and thus accelerates test runs. |
|  [shutDown()](./tryorama.trycpscenario.shutdown.md) |  | Shut down all conductors of all clients in the scenario. |
